Preliminary Statement

This repository contains a basic static HTML implementation created strictly for practical and educational purposes.
The content hosted here is a sample work, maintained only to demonstrate fundamental concepts such as static site creation, public hosting, and link-based access.

If you are expecting anything beyond this, please adjust your expectations accordingly.

Project Description

This project consists of:

* A single static HTML page
* A short informal message displayed publicly
* No backend logic
* No frameworks
* No unnecessary complexity

In other words, this repository exists to show that sometimes “simple” is enough, even though the internet strongly believes everything must be over-engineered.

---

Educational Intent

The sole objectives of this project are:

* To understand how HTML files function
* To learn how static websites are hosted
* To test public accessibility via shared links
* To maintain a sample project for future reference

This is practice material.
This is not a production-grade application.

For Reviewers, Recruiters, and Overly Curious Humans

If you are:

* Reading this README line by line
* Analysing folder structure
* Checking commit history
* Judging skill level based on this repo

Please pause.

This project is intentionally minimal.
Using this repository to assess technical expertise is like judging someone’s cooking skills by tasting plain rice.

Saapda mudiyum. Aana adhu biriyani illa.

Common Misunderstandings (Clarified in Advance)

* “Why no JavaScript?”
  Because it was not required.

* “Why no CSS framework?”
  Because adding Bootstrap to center text is a crime.

* “Why so simple?”
  Because learning starts with basics, not buzzwords.

* “Why is the README longer than the code?”
  Because documentation often works harder than the implementation. This is real-world accuracy.

On the Hosted Message

The message displayed on the site is casual and informal by design.
It exists only as a **content placeholder** for testing visibility and user interaction through a shared link.

It does not represent:

* Branding strategy
* Marketing intent
* Philosophical depth
* Or emotional investment

It is simply text.
Adha text ah dhaan eduthukonga.

Disclaimer (Please Read Before Overthinking)

Everything in this repository:

* Is created for learning and experimentation
* Is maintained as a sample reference
* Is not meant to impress anyone
* Is not meant to disappoint anyone either

If you feel impressed, that is your generosity.
If you feel disappointed, that is your expectation problem.

Rendum project oda fault illa.

Final Note for Those Who Reached This Section

If you are still reading, congratulations.
You have officially spent more time on this README than the time taken to build the project.

This repository has achieved its secondary objective:

* Testing patience
* Filtering seriousness
* Lightly roasting without being obvious

If you understood the humour, good.
If you didn’t, also good. This repo was never meant to explain itself.

---

Conclusion

This repository stands as:

* A practical exercise
* A sample implementation
* A reminder that not everything online is meant to be complex

Sometimes a static page is just a static page.

Thank you for your time.
You may now safely close this repository.
